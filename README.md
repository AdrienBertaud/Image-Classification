### Purpose
One of the oldest traditions in deep learning is to first tackle the fun problem of MNIST classification. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used as a first test for new classification algorithms. We follow this tradition to investigate the performance of artificial neural networks of different complexity on MNIST. However, since MNIST is too easy for accessing the full power of modern machine learning algorithms, we extend our analysis to the recently introduced, harder Fashion-MNIST dataset.
